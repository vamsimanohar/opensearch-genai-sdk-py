"""OTLP span exporters with AWS SigV4 support.

Provides a drop-in replacement for OTLPSpanExporter that signs
requests using AWS Signature Version 4 for AWS-hosted OpenSearch
and Data Prepper endpoints.

Design note
-----------
The previous implementation signed a *synthetic* request with an empty body
(``data=b""``) and patched the Authorization header onto the exporter's
internal ``_session``. That approach was incorrect: AWS SigV4 includes
``SHA256(body)`` in the canonical request, so signing over an empty body
while sending a non-empty protobuf payload produces a body-hash mismatch
and a ``403 SignatureDoesNotMatch`` from AWS.

The fix (same approach as aws-otel-python-instrumentation) is to subclass
``requests.Session`` and override ``request()``.  By the time ``request()``
is called, the OTLP exporter has already serialized the spans into protobuf
bytes and passed them as ``data=``.  We sign over that real payload, so the
body hash in the Authorization header always matches what AWS receives.

``OTLPSpanExporter`` (and its parent ``OTLPExporterMixin``) accept a
``session=`` constructor argument and use it for all HTTP calls, so there
is no need to override ``export()`` or touch ``_session`` after init.

    A ``_SigV4AuthSession`` is passed to the parent ``OTLPSpanExporter``

    that session, so every export is signed over the real protobuf body.

        endpoint: The OTLP endpoint URL.
        service: The AWS service name for signing. Use "osis" for
            OpenSearch Ingestion, "es" for OpenSearch Service direct.
        region: AWS region. Auto-detected from botocore if not provided.
        **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to OTLPSpanExporter.

    Example:
