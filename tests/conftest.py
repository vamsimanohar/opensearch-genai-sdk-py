"""Shared test fixtures for opensearch-genai-sdk-py tests.

Sets up a TracerProvider with InMemorySpanExporter so tests can capture
and assert on spans without a real collector.

A single TracerProvider is shared across the entire test session.
The exporter is cleared before and after every test via the autouse
_clear_spans fixture so tests never see each other's spans.

Because the SDK decorators fetch trace.get_tracer() at call time (not at
decoration/import time), the global provider set here is always resolved
correctly when a decorated function is invoked — no private API hacks
required.
