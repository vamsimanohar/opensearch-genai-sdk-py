"""Shared test fixtures for opensearch-genai-sdk-py tests.

Sets up a TracerProvider with InMemorySpanExporter so tests can capture
and assert on spans without a real collector.

A single TracerProvider is shared across the entire test session because
the OTEL SDK's ProxyTracer caches the real tracer on first use and does
not re-resolve when the global provider changes. By keeping one provider
alive for the whole session and clearing the exporter between tests we
avoid this caching issue entirely.
